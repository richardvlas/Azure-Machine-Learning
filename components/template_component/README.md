# What is an Azure Machine Learning component?
An Azure Machine Learning component (previously known as a module) is a self-contained piece of code that does one step in a machine learning pipeline. Components are the building blocks of advanced machine learning pipelines (see [Create and run machine learning pipelines with the Azure Machine Learning CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-component-pipelines-cli)). Components can do tasks such as data processing, model training, model scoring, and so on.

A component is analogous to a function - it has a name, parameters, expects input, and returns output. For more information on creating a component, see [create a component](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-component#define-a-component-preview).
